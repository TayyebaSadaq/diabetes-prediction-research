Extended version of my academic dissertation exploring diabetes prediction using machine learning and Explainable AI (XAI).  

**Note: This project is currently on hold.**

## Overview

This repository investigates different machine learning approaches for predicting diabetes onset and interpreting model behavior through XAI techniques.  
The project includes exploratory analysis, preprocessing pipelines, model experimentation, and the early structure of a deployable application.

Although development is paused, the repository reflects the work completed to date and can serve as a foundation for future progress or reference.

- backend API and frontend Interface for users

## Project Status
**ON HOLD**

Development will continue in the future, however the current version serves as a reference and snapshot
